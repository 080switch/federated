# TensorFlow Federated Collaborations

## Welcome!

One of the key goals for TensorFlow Federated is to serve as a platform for
collaborations and joint development in the open between Google and the OSS
community and industry partners.

The purpose of this GitHub directory, and documents linked from here, is to
bootstrap an initial lightweight and open process for jointly evolving TFF.

To join conversations with other developers contributing to the TFF ecosystem,
please join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/5shux83qZ5).

Additionally, here (in this directory) we will accumulate artifacts (proposals,
notes, etc.) from conversations about project scoping, planning, logistics, and
design, product and development roadmaps jointly developed with partners, and
pointers to components maintained by community contributors.

Content included here and on the Discord server is publicly accessible by all
interested parties. We will eventually evolve and scale out the process, form
workgroups, etc., as needed.

If you'd like to participate in these conversations, please join conversations
in workstreas that interest you on our Discord server, introduce yourself, and
tell us a few words about how you would like to contribute to the TFF ecosystem.
The expectation of all workstream participants is to make regular engineering
contributions.

# TensorFlow Federated Research

See also
[TFF for Research](https://github.com/tensorflow/federated/blob/master/docs/tff_for_research.md).

This directory contains TFF research projects that will be used for research
papers or as canonical examples of how to use TFF.

These research projects are intended to have a dependency on TFF but not other
research projects. Similarly, TFF should not have a dependency on a research
project. Additionally, these research projects may require depndencies that TFF
does not also require; these dependencies should be documented in the README of
the research project.
